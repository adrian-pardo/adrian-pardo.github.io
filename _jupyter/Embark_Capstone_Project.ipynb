    "My capstone project was a collaboration with Embark Veterinary, a provider of genetic testing services for dogs. The project aimed to improve our ability to **predict a particular set of health conditions and fur/coat color traits based on the dogâ€™s genetic condition**. The goal of this project was to apply broader supervised methods to predict the disease state directly from the raw, unclustered genetic assay data. The following technologies were utilized:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pandas\n",
    "- Matplotlib\n",
    "- Sklearn \n",
    "- Python Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the following predicitive algorithms were utilized:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multi-nominal Logistic Regression\n",
    "- k-NN\n",
    "- SVM\n",
    "- Random Forest"
