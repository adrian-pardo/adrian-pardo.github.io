# MS Analytics Capstone Project: Embark Veterinary

# 1 Introduction

My capstone project was a collaboration with Embark Veterinary, a provider of genetic testing services for dogs. The project aimed to improve our ability to **predict a particular set of health conditions and fur/coat color traits based on the dogâ€™s genetic condition**. The goal of this project was to apply broader supervised methods to predict the disease state directly from the raw, unclustered genetic assay data. The following technologies were utilized:

- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Sklearn 
- Python Jupyter notebooks

Additionally, the following predicitive algorithms were utilized:

- Multi-nominal Logistic Regression
- k-NN
- SVM
- Random Forest
