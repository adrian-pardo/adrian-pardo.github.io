# Research Experience

**Research Coordinator**

*PIH Health Hospital, Whittier, CA*

*OCT 2016 - JAN 2018*

* Managed Clinical Trial Phases II-III as part of a nationwide team comprised of physicians and research
coordinators to collect data regarding the viability of shared-decision making as a teaching tool for
underrepresented groups afflicted with osteoarthritis.
* Utilized EHR data and algorithmic tool (e.g. Hidden Markov Modeling) to generate personalized health information for each patient.
* Facilitated data collection by communicating with patients in either English or Spanish, administering
paperwork, clarifying potential treatment options, gathering feedback, and using REDCAP database.
* Served as liaison between research site, clinical trial network staff, collaborators and investigators.

**Research Assistant**

*University of California, Riverside: Department of Psychology*

*SEP 2015 - JUN 2016*

* Researched iconic memory in humans by working with over 100 study participants over a 10-month period.
* Operated MATLAB software to administer computational neuroscience memory tests, electrophysiological (EEG) recordings, and eye-tracking experiments to collect quantitative information regarding human memory.

**Research Assistant**

*University of California, Riverside: Department of Botany & Plant Sciences*

*MAR 2014 - JUN 2015*

* Performed statistical significance testing (e.g. ANOVA) to determine efficiency of biofuels from transgenic tobacco plants.
* Collected quantitative and qualitative data by completing over twenty wet lab procedures to prepare glycosyl composition of whole cell wall fraction, highly purified tobacco cell walls, and alcohol-insoluble residues.
